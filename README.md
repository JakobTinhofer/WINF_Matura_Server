# WINF Matura 2021/2022
A small webapp providing an overview of the matura topics for informatics in the schoolyear of 2021/2022. When finished, this webapp should allow for blog-like activities. 

This Project was realized on the MESN-Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Svelte.js and Node.js) and is mainly an experiment for me to explore these technologies

DISCLAMER: This project is more of a personal project / experiment with technologies new for me. A lot of the code here is terrible, since this is a learning process. But still, this code (mostly) works. If you find an issue, feel free to let mer know! :)
